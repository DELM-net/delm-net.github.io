Peter,Fraundorfer,Trinity College Dublin,fraundop@tcd.ie,https://tcd.academia.edu/PeterFraundorfer,,,,I am mostly interested in DELM as a forum to discuss different interpretations and to further the standardization of terminology used by paleographers like Lowe and Bischoff.

In my projects I combine methods of comparative philology and historical linguistics with those of the digital humanities."
Matthias M.,Tischler,ICREA/Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,matthias.tischler@icrea.cat,https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/matthias--m.-tischler-241684,https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/imafo/forschung/historische-identitaetsforschung/projekte/carolingian-culture-in-septimania-and-catalonia,http://postcarolingianworld.ac.at/resources-2/,https://webs.uab.cat/luculentius/,"My current research focuses on the full reconstruction of the Carolingian text and manuscript heritage in Septimania and Catalonia from the ninth to the twelfth century. This is the first comprehensive study of the transformative impact of the so-called ‘Carolingian Reform’ on a central periphery of the Carolingian empire, a political, ecclesiastical and cultural key zone of the post-Visigothic world. The basis of all my projects is the text and manuscript database ""Carolingian Catalonia"" (Car.Cat), an innovative DH tool as it reconstructs and visualises for the first time the dynamics of Carolingian transformation of an entire landscape of handwriting and book culture of its own."
Jacopo,Bisagni,University of Galway,jacopo.bisagni@universityofgalway.ie,https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/languages-literatures-and-cultures/jacopobisagni/,https://ircabritt.nuigalway.ie/,,,"My IRCABRITT project (2018–2023), funded by the Irish Research Council (Laureate Scheme), focussed on the transmission of computistical and exegetical texts between Ireland, Brittany, and Francia in the Carolingian age. 
One of the project's key achievements was the online publication of a 'Descriptive Handlist of Breton Manuscripts, c. AD 780–1100' (<a href=”https://ircabritt.nuigalway.ie/handlist”>https://ircabritt.nuigalway.ie/handlist</a>), listing and describing 225 manuscripts, with particular attention given to their dating and localisation."
Colleen,Curran,University of Galway,colleen.curran@universityofgalway.ie,,,,,"I am currently working on BretPal, a Marie Curie-funded Digital Humanities project.

I use digital datasets and computational analysis to investigate manuscript layout, combinations and sequences of texts, and transmission patterns. My recent projects, including the ERC-project 'Patristic Sermons in the Middle Ages' (PASSIM), focused on the medieval reception of late-antique Latin preaching, with specific attention to the development of early medieval liturgical homiliaries and their effect on the sermons' textual integrity and popularity."
